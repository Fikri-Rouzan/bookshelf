Bookshelf App was the final project I worked on to complete the Belajar Membuat Front-End Web untuk Pemula class from Dicoding. The features on this website included:

- Add Books: Users can write the title, author, and year of the book to be added to the bookshelf. There is also a checkbox option for finished reading if the user wants to add the book to the finished reading bookshelf, otherwise the book will be added to the unfinished reading bookshelf.
- Search for Books: Users can search for books in the bookshelf by the book title.
- Edit Books: Users can edit the title, author, and year of the book if there is incorrect information when it was added to the bookshelf.
- Update the Status of Books: Users can change the status of a book from unfinished to finished when the book has been read, and vice versa.
- Delete Books: Users can delete a book from the bookshelf.
- Responsive: Optimized for both mobile and desktop use, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Languages: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
- Software: Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
